## color-picker-and-theory-kivy
* An app (mainly designed for android, but actually a cross platform project) to pick the right color for your next design
  * RGB color picker
  * VIBGYR color picker (This picker uses Violet–Indigo–Blue–Green–Yellow–Red system to pick that color)
  * Blending colors
  * Gradient color picker
  * As you can see, this app limitaies user to use only slider values, instead of getting manual input, and turns the processing easier and faster.
  * You can choose 3 different codes for any languages, you can get rgba(), #hexa and kivy(percentage codes) to use in your desired form
  * You can use this as an rgba-hexa-percentage code converter too!
  * You can turn on/off transperent value (such as, get rgb instead of rgba)
  * You can copy it and paste directly in your codes
  * Also some theory of color viewing systems

#### My next aim was to add a color detector using android camera, but, then I came to know that Kivy is something like newer python library and it has many problems using android camera, kivy is easier to learn and I spend just 3 weeks learning kivy and making this 3.5k line app. I think Kivy is (something like) being replaced by KivyMd and has less community support.
#### I turned to MERN Stack for betterment  ঁ-ঁ
